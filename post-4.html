                                <p>My experience with the written and video instructions were quite different, although some of this difference arguably had more to do with me than it did the instructions themselves. In general, I find written instructions easier to understand than video instructions. With video instructions, it is far too easy for me to become distracted and miss important directions; I must then rewind the video to the point I missed, which is tedious and difficult to do precisely enough to be effective. In contrast, with a written guide, I may still become distracted, but I do not lose as much in the process, as I can come back to where I left off at any time. More generally, I also find it easier to identify word-based instruction than visual instruction, and text based explanations tend to rely more on the former. This assignment was no exception as I found it difficult to keep up when relying on the video instructions.</p> 
                                <p>With regard to the instructions themselves, there were a few noteworthy things about both the written and video instructions. One thing I enjoyed about the video instruction was the laying out of various parts and tools on the assembly surface, even when they were not in use. It was helpful to be able to keep track of each of the needed components for assembly. With regard to the written instructions, I greatly enjoyed the use of 3d models to show each step, rather than photographs; it is easier to understand the instructions visually when there is no hand obstructing oneâ€™s view. With that said, there are several changes I would make to the current system of instructions. Currently, the only written instructions available are out of date, and very difficult to find at that; the e-NABLE page for the hand puts heavy emphasis on instructions in video form. As stated, I find written instructions far easier to use, and this is in part due to issues surrounding my own disabilities; it is therefore ironic that I should face such issues with assembling a device meant for the disabled. Even more ironic, however, is the fact that the only captions available on the videos are auto-generated YouTube captions, which are not reliable; accurate captions written by a human should clearly be made available. While I am not wholly dependent on such captions as some people are, I would certainly have benefitted from having better ones. Overall, the current system is usable, but not optimal for everyone who may be interested in assembling the hand.</p>

                                <p>The assembly process can be divided into three main phases. The first phase was by far the simplest; printing and identifying each of the pieces. After downloading the model for the Phoenix hand, we imported the design into Idea Maker, resized to 150% scale, connected to a Raise 3D printer, and began the print. Since the print was time consuming and our time was limited, we were loaned an existing set with the expectation that our pieces would be used to replace that reserve set once they were finished. From here, each piece in the set was identified; for most pieces this was quite trivial as their appearances were sufficiently distinct. One exception to this was the pins, particularly the two used for the thumb, which could easily be confused for one another. However, this was far from insurmountable, and thereafter we moved to the next phase; assembling the various 3D printed components.</p>
                                <figure>

                                <p>This mainly consisted of aligning the finger components with each other and/or the palm component and inserting the aforementioned pins to keep the fingers in place. This was mostly an easy process, although at one point a pin was inserted somewhat prematurely, affixing only one finger when it was intended to affix two. This was not easy to rectify as the pins are not meant to be removed, but it was possible. Another thing we noticed while assembling was that some pins did not fit well into the intended holes. This needed to be rectified through sanding, which is obviously less than ideal. It is not clear if this is the result of a design issue or of varying measurements between the model and the actual 3D print. In any case, the 3D printed components were eventually fully assembled, so we moved on to the final phase: affixing non-3D printed components.</p>

                                <p>These components consisted of rubber finger pads to make the gripping components more effective and rubber bands and wire to ensure that the hand moved in the intended fashion. It is at this point that the written instructions diverged from the current version of the design, referencing components which are no longer present. Therefore, we relied on the video for the final part of the assembly. The only part of note here, at least for me, was stringing the wire. This required a lot of fine motor skills, which I struggle with greatly; in particular, I likely would have found this to be exceedingly difficult at 100% scale. That said, I do not believe there is any way to avoid this specific issue, and at 150% scale it was something I was capable of doing. After adding a few finishing touches, such as Velcro straps, the hand was complete.</p>

                                <p>My idea for a modified hand is a very simple one, but it accomplishes a fundamentally important task; holding a writing instrument. This is done using two modifications, one of which is additive and the other subtractive. The first is to affix a small, adjustable-size ring to the inside of the index and middle fingers. The writing instrument is inserted into the ring, and it is tightened around the instrument. The second modification relates to the thumb; the central knuckle joint is removed, to better approximate how one grips a pencil with a natural hand. In all likelihood, this would be the full extent of the modifications for the first iteration of the modified hand. Several other iterations would probably be useful, but would require some testing beforehand. These include modifying the angle of the thumb and decreasing the amount by which the fingers would bend. While these are almost certainly necessary, the exact extent of the modifications is not immediately obvious, so they should be saved for the second iteration or later, after an initial physical model.</p>

                                <p>This was a far shorter and less creatively involved project than previous projects, so I feel as though there were fewer lessons to be learned with this project. However, I did have a few takeaways from this project nonetheless. The first was regarding the instructions; both their strengths and weaknesses emphasized to me the importance of creating and maintaining proper documentation. This was already a concept that I was aware of, albeit more in the context of computer programming, but I have a greater appreciation for it now. Furthermore, the modifications I came up with were an interesting exercise, allowing me to revisit some of the fundamental principles behind engineering that have been discussed in this class. This portion also emphasized once again the importance of iteration since as mentioned, there are several modifications that are only suitable for a second iteration, and undoubtedly there are more modifications that will become more obvious over the course of those two iterations. Overall, this particular project was a helpful introduction to the e-NABLE hand as well, which will undoubtedly be useful for subsequent projects. In conclusion, while not a creative endeavor to the same degree as previous projects, this was still an interesting and helpful experience.</p>
