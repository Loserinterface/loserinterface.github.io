                                        <p>Our initial concept for the wheelchair enhancement was rather complicated, consisting of four distinct parts and several non-3D printed components. First, a NinjaFlex covering would be placed on the end of the front pylon on each side. This would be linked to some sort of mechanism to allow for adjustment of the angle; the exact nature of this mechanism was not immediately clear. From this, a pair of beams, one inside the other, would be used to create an adjustable length mechanism similar to that seen on the wheel pylons of the wheelchair itself; this would require a non-3D printed metal pin to hold in place. Finally, a pinball plunger would be attached to the bottom to create a “foot” to make the apparatus more comfortable for the user. This was quite an ambitious concept; at the same time, certain aspects of it were quite vague. With this in mind, we began making our first prints, hoping that through creating preliminary models, the rest of the design would become more clear.</p>

                                        <p>Our initial printing involved three components. The first was an elliptical bar, meant to be a stand-in for the wheelchair so we could test fitting. The second was the NinjaFlex covering previously mentioned, with a built-in peg to use as a crude pivot system. The hole for this covering to fit onto the bar was slightly smaller than the bar itself, with the idea being that the cover would stretch to accommodate the bar. The third was a small bar, with a hole matching the peg in the cover, which would pivot around the peg. Once this was created, it became obvious that several improvements were needed. Namely, expecting the cover to stretch significantly was unrealistic, while a better pivoting system was also clearly needed. This prompted a great deal of discussion, which ultimately resulted in an improved design.</p>

                                        <p>The first improvement we made concerned the attachment at the bottom of the beam. This was first changed from a pinball plunger to a bicycle kickstand, then in turn changed to a 3D printed NinjaFlex “foot” which would not need to be externally sourced. Additionally, the length adjustment that had previously been proposed was dropped as angle adjustment was deemed sufficient to allow for comfortable use. Finally, the angle adjustment system was refined considerably. After brief consideration of a mechanism involving a “gear” cut-out in the covering which could be removed and rotated, we settled on a very simple solution: screwing the beam onto the covering in such a way that it could be unscrewed and rotated. This necessitated splitting the cover into two parts; an inner cover made of NinjaFlex and an outer cover made of PLA. (Only the latter can make an effective screw-hole.) This meant that only one non-3D printed component ended up being needed for the final product; a metal screw, which was already available in the classroom. Four components would need to be printed; the outer cover, the inner cover, the supportive beam, and the foot. After our initial printing, minor adjustments to the outer box were made, making the screw-hole go all the way through the box and incorporating a second, mirror-image box for the other side. With this, an effective design had been crafted.</p>

                                        <p>In addition to reinforcing the general philosophy behind engineering, especially that the final design may not be immediately clear from the outset and that discussion greatly aids in the design process, I learned a few other lessons from this project. One such lesson is that it is often possible (and preferable) to source minimal amounts of materials from without, as opposed to creating them for oneself. The other lesson I learned was far more specific, and it concerns the limits of 3D printing. This is the creation of screw-holes, which I have come to believe should be avoided in 3D printing. In Fusion 360, creating these holes is unintuitive; it requires using the “hole” feature and entering in measurements using a somewhat confusing interface. Far more importantly, screw-holes require very precise prints; since the rather simple Prusa Mini and Lulzbot printers used to create these holes were imprecise, the threading was not especially useful. While tools exist to add threading to finished prints, these are difficult to use as they require carving into the print. In retrospect, an alternate system, possibly using a metal nut, would have been preferable. Nonetheless, I still believe that our design proved an effective supplement to the existing product.</p>
