                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">

                            <p>As we assembled the 3d printer, one thing I took note of was the level of care to make the instructions as understandable as possible. One helpful way in which this was done was through the use of color coding. Any time a step included a bulleted list and an illustration, which included most of the steps in the instructions, each bullet would be given its own color. In the illustration for that step, arrows in colors corresponding to each bullet point were used to point to the components that bullet point referenced. This is a feature that is incredibly helpful, yet is not found in many other instruction manuals, which often forgo color entirely as a cost-saving measure. This is one of many elements that point to a philosophy of product design that truly prioritizes the user’s comfort and convenience, which I greatly appreciated. </p>
                            <p>While a relatively minor complaint, one issue I took with the documentation was the way the screws were handled; I found it was easy to get the screws confused. All of them were referred to by very similar, very technical names. This was made even more confusing by the fact that some screws were already installed in the machine and needed to be removed. However, by far the largest source of confusion was because the screws differed only in their length, being completely identical in material and diameter. These things, put together, created a great deal of confusion with regard to which steps called for which screws. While it was possible to figure this out, there is a simple way in which it could have been made easier: additional color coding, not unlike what was discussed in the previous paragraph. Simply painting a small part of the screws a different color, or changing the materials of the screws, would have made it easier to follow the instructions. While it would have likely cost more to do this, the same can be said of the full-color manuals, and these were included. It seems an odd issue for a product so heavily oriented towards user convenience to have so little distinguishing the screws from one another.</p>
                            <p>The 3DBenchy print turned out quite well, despite some difficulties in configuration initially. The surfaces all appeared to be reasonably smooth, and the structure appeared to be quite stable. A few minor differences in proportions were found using the calipers, however. Overall, the height of the boat was slightly larger than was expected, while the box located behind the cabin of the boat, which was fairly close to the center of the model, was slightly smaller than expected. It is not totally clear to me what caused this, but I believe the most likely explanation was that the model stretched slightly towards the outer edges, thereby compacting the center. It is possible that modifying the “shell” settings on the printer could remedy this in some fashion, but it is clear that trial and error is required.</p>

                            <p>As will be discussed later, it is difficult for me to describe what occurred during the initial assembly; however, I was able to begin constructing a second 3D printer at a later date, which I can describe in far greater detail. While I was not able to finish, I was able to connect all electronic components to their appropriate locations on the circuit board, which is a significant amount of progress. This began with the LCD cable, which did not seem to align very well with the opening and connection port. Connecting the XZ and Y axes was the next step; I found that it was quite difficult to properly screw the components together. Then came the LCD display, the Y-axis motor, and finally the filament and heat sensors. Throughout the experience, I found myself somewhat frustrated at the difficulty of making everything fit properly. This is as much about who I am as a person as it is about the design; I have some difficulty with fine motor skills. More generally, assembling things by hand is often difficult for me. However, this means that I stand to benefit greatly from the use of 3D printers, making the effort worthwhile. The process of printing out the 3D Benchy and measuring it was not particularly remarkable, although it did yield the above observations regarding measurements. Optimizing the print for speed was interesting as well, although the resulting print was of such poor quality as to be wholly impractical.</p>

                            <p>I feel it is important to discuss some valuable lessons I have learned. I found it difficult to take ample notes during the initial 3D printer assembly. This was mainly because I have not made a habit of taking notes “in the moment” during classes; I generally find it difficult to keep pace with lectures, and prefer to be able to confront the concepts presented in greater detail on my own time. This works well for a lecture format, but it is not an effective strategy for an engineering lab, where one’s own personal experiences should be regarded with equal, if not greater, importance compared to any academic information. Similarly, I did not take nearly enough pictures as this is also not something I am in the habit of doing. (All of this, and even my participation in that lab, was severely hindered by difficulties sleeping the previous night, despite my best efforts; however, I am not entirely sure what I can learn from that.) In future engineering matters, both in this class and outside of it, I will be sure to take more diligent notes.</p>
